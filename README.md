# Digital Life Narrative AI

### Reconstructing meaningful life stories from your scattered digital memories — using Gemini AI

---

## 🚀 What this project does

Most of our lives are spread across:
- old phones
- cloud backups
- Snapchat memories
- Google Photos exports
- Facebook archives
- random hard drives

This project takes those fragmented digital traces and — **with AI at the core** — reconstructs:

- life chapters  
- major places and time periods  
- recurring people and themes  
- meaningful milestones  
- an interactive narrative timeline  

Instead of just sorting photos by date, it creates an **actual story of your life**.

## 🧠 Why AI is essential (not optional)

Without AI this is just a file organizer.  
With Gemini, it becomes a *life historian*.

AI is used to:
- infer context from metadata
- detect life periods and turning points
- identify gaps in your digital history
- generate narrative summaries and reflections
- label themes like travel, school, relationships, growth

Remove AI → the entire value disappears.

## 🔐 Privacy philosophy

- files stay local
- only metadata is optionally sent to Gemini
- user controls what leaves device
- supports **local-only non-AI mode** for safety
- no data is stored or uploaded by the app
